      <p>Hi my name is Jonathan Graber and I’m from Los Angeles California.
      I am a 4th year in the sociology department at UCSC. I’m new to computer
      programming but have learned a ton through making this project. However,
      I’ve always been interested in how our technological world is created.</p>
      <h2>Lokinah Khan</h2>

      <p>Hi, my name is Loki Khan. I’m an art major at UCSC in my fourth
        year. My practice mainly consists of printmaking, painting, and
        digital art. I’ve always been interested in learning how to code
        and figuring out ways to bring art and technology together, as well
        as combining both communities.</p>
      <h2>Riley Mann</h2>

      <p>Hi, my name is Riley Mann. I was born and raised in Monterey, California.
        I’m currently studying for Robotics Engineering. I love drones and robots.
        If it has colorful LEDs, I’m all for it. I’m always interested in the boundary
        between the virtual and physical world and making that boundary more blurred.
        My favorite programming language is Python but many of my projects have used Java
        and C. This was one of my first experiences with JavaScript and it’s been a blast.
        I’ve learned just how amazing a web browser is as a tool for organizing and sharing
        information as well as for creating interactive programs.</p>
      <h2>Alexa Marquez</h2>
      <img src="img/alexa.jpg" class="center">
      <p>Hello! My name is Alexa Marquez. I'm from San Diego, California and I am currently
        in the Art & Design: Games and Playable Media program at UCSC. I grew up playing games
        with my siblings on our Game Cube and getting scolded by our mom for staying up so late.
        The experiences I had with my siblings are ones that I hope for others to create through
        games or other interactive works.</p>
