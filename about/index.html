  <h3>Jonathan Graber</h3>
  <p>Hi my name is Jonathan Graber and I’m from Los Angeles California.
  I am a 4th year in the sociology department at UCSC. I’m new to computer
  programming but have learned a ton through making this project. However,
  I’ve always been interested in how our technological world is created.</p>

  <p>Hi, my name is Riley Mann. I was born and raised in Monterey, California.
    I’m currently studying for Robotics Engineering. I love drones and robots.
    If it has colorful LEDs, I’m all for it. I’m always interested in the boundary
    between the virtual and physical world and making that boundary more blurred.
    My favorite programming language is Python but many of my projects have used Java
    and C. This was one of my first experiences with JavaScript and it’s been a blast.
    I’ve learned just how amazing a web browser is as a tool for organizing and sharing
    information as well as for creating interactive programs.</p>
